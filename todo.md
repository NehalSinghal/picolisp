## PilBox

Alex: 

I think there is no really simple way. However, to show 2D-structures visually,
possibly animated, the 'grid' function in @lib/simul.l is very useful and easy.
I used it already in dozens of cases, and Mike Pechkin also used it a lot in
RosettaCode tasks.

It is used as a chess board in https://software-lab.de/chess.tgz (in the CLI
version). Also, it is used in the "Demo" PilBox App: In "Life" in "fields.l",
and "Forest Fire" in "canvas.l"). Note that "Forest Fire" uses both a grid and a
canvas. Both "Life" and "Forest Fire" are also as tasks in RosettaCode.

Anither good example for a grid is "[maze.l](maze.l)" (I showed once in PilCon). I'll
attach it here, you can start it as "pil maze.l -maze~main -go +".
